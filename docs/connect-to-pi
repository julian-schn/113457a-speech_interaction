# How to connect to our raspberry pi

I have set up a Tailscale mesh network which you can connect to, and then SSH into the Pi with e.g. VSC

1. Download Tailscale (you will need the CLI to get the Pis local IP) with homebrew using ``brew install tailscale``
2. Connect to Tailnet (ask me for access, I will invite you)
3. Run ``tailscale status`` and copy ``hdmpi``s IP address
4. In VSC click the blue button on the bottom left,
5. Connect ``admin@<pi-local-ip>``
6. Done!

The Pi should automatically connect to the Tailscale network whenever it is booted on, provided it has an active internet connection
